    <h3>The Free BitTorrent™ Bundle</h3>
    As announced last month, Marvel Comics is continuing to spotlight this year’s breakout Marvel Super Hero – the Black Panther – through a monthly video series that masterfully merges animated comics, commentary from Black Panther writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, and a pulse-pounding musical score from the hottest artists in hip hop.
 
The first video featuring music from Run the Jewels premiered in May, and this week Marvel is debuting the second video in the series, featuring the world premiere of “Beast with It” by Mark the Beast Ft. Prodigy as the score.
 
Each video in the series features innovative recaps of the red hot Black Panther comic series – written by The Atlantic national correspondent and National Book Award winner, Ta-Nehisi Coates -- that will hit the day before each new issue hits stores.  Not only an exciting way to catch up on the comic series, but the videos have been also designed to serve as standalone entertainment, giving viewers a behind-the-scenes look at the new series’ creation.
